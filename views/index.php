    <p>I love food, socialising, digital art, music, have a passion for design and people call me Jake. I started designing when I was 11 and haven't looked back since. Even my love for gaming had to take 2nd place. Now I am in the 4th and final year of my degree having worked as a designer for The Walt Disney Company in London for the past year.</p>
